Small commandline tool to convert old 1.13 xml data to newer format. For now, it only processes MercOpinions.xml

How to use:
Download binary from release and call it from cmd and supply it with a path to the MercOpinions.xml file you want to convert.

Eg. 
JA2-ConvertXMLData "C:\Games\JA2 1.13\Data-1.13\TableData\MercOpinions.xml"

The new file will be in the same folder as source file with the name "MercOpinions out.xml". Replace old .xml with the new one after you're sure it's correct.
